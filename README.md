A Rubik's Cube created in Unity, and controllable through code with simple functions (e.g. rotate(Rotation) in Assets/Cube.cs.) **There is no user interface, it just rotates according to a hard-coded string of rotations (see Assets/Main.cs.)** If you want different rotations, you can just change this string and re-compile.

A pre-compiled version (for Windows) can be found here: https://developer.cloud.unity3d.com/build/orgs/serg06/projects/rubiks_solver/
